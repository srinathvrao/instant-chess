# Instant-Chess

What's better than a virtually unbeatable chessbot?

A chessbot with an inflated ego, thanks to [Deepseek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)!

You can play against it at [instantgames.org](https://instantgames.org/). Be warned, it may engage in playful banter. No offense intended by me- the creator of this project.

Up next: turn indicators + play against AI.

Run this npm install command to set stuff up for development:

```bash
npm install @instantdb/react react-chessboard chess.js @react-oauth/google js-cookie
```
