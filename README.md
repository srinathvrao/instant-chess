# Instant-Chess

What's better than a virtually unbeatable chessbot?

A chessbot with an inflated ego, thanks to [Deepseek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)!

You can play against it at [instant-chess.vercel.app](https://instant-chess.vercel.app). Be warned, it may engage in playful banter. No offense intended by me- the creator of this project.

## build
